potential LTA problem,"impact / relevance
1 - high (prevents successful mission)
2 - medium (has some influence, e.g. delays 
     missions / reduces quality of results)
3 - low (no / minor influence on mission)

","difficulty to detect / solve
1 - easy (simple solutions)
2 - medium (requires some effort, 
     but doable in the scope of the work)
3 - hard (general problem)
","likelihood of occurrence
1 - very likely (have experienced this in practice several times)
2 - occurs (e.g. have experienced this once / heard of it)
3 - highly unlikely (never seen / heard of it)
