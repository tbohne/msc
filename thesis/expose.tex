\section{Goal}

As the title suggests, the goal of the work is to develop / integrate a prototypical system for long-term autonomous plant monitoring with a mobile robot.\newline

The first essential step towards long-term autonomy of a mobile robot is of course to ensure its power supply.
For this purpose, there is an inductive charging station, which is located in a mobile container on the field site.
Thus, the power supply is realized by an autonomous docking / undocking solution, which enables the robot to detect the container in a laser scan
of its nearby surroundings, drive into it and dock to an inductive charging station. To know when to trigger this docking procedure, it is crucial 
to have a process that monitors the battery level. Based on the dimensions of the particular field under consideration, it is not assured that one battery 
charge will be sufficient to process every parcel.\newline

When the power supply is established, the robot's actual task can be performed. This task consists of planning when to observe which parcel of the field,
how to get there, and what sensors to use. Based on the growth state of the plants, different sensors are required to record the relevant data.
Just as important as the planning itself, is the execution of the generated plan as well as monitoring the execution.
So, in general this will be a task of plan-based robot control.
Although the overall tour, the robot is going to drive through is generally always the same, there are certain stopping conditions 
such as a low battery level or drastic weather changes that lead to a preemption of an active scanning tour and require the robot 
to move back to its base, i.e. the mobile container. Afterwards, when the cause of the preemption is resolved, 
the robot should continue its scanning task right from the point where it was preempted.\newline

The plan, i.e. the decision of which parcel is to be processed next, is based on a list of criteria. The primary criterion is the growth stage of the plants.
There is a list of particular features that are supposed to be detected based on the current growth state.
At the moment, this information is communicated manually, but in the future it is planned to have that automated.
It is well traceable in time when a certain feature is to be expected such that this process could be time-triggered.\newline

Finally, the goal is to generate a complete picture of every parcel on the field, not randomly, but time targeted and based on weather conditions. 
Especially when considering hyperspectral data, it is important that it is neither too sunny, nor too cloudy, ideally it should be grey and foggy with uniform illumination.
Of course, it's not trivial to predict the weather.\newline

Initially, a prototypical setup of a long-term autonomous plant monitoring scenario will be developed that can be tested and evaluated 
in a physics simulation, i.e. Gazebo. Ultimately, there should be a long-term experiment (e.g. one day) in the real world with the actual hardware that
underlines the relevance of the approaches discussed in this work for practical applications. Since there are arbitrary many technical barriers that 
could prevent a practical success in a long-term test, the idea is to be at least able to show it in a sufficiently realistic physical simulation.\newline

The nature of the work is going to be integrative and application-oriented, many modules that are needed to solve the task at hand are available in principle, 
but it will be the goal of this work to identify those, evaluate them empirically for their particular part of the task and integrate them in a wholesome 
solution that is capable of providing an example of a robust solution for practical applications.\newline

\textbf{LTA}\newline

The whole problem becomes interesting through the fact that not all scan positions can be processed in one battery cycle.
We are going to define that one cycle suffices to process e.g. 40\% of the scan positions and the planner should maximize the planned scan stops under the
constraint of not exceeding a safety buffer. Additionally, there is a monitoring process to keep track of potential failures.\newline

\section{Assumptions of the work - what do I want to integrate?}

Prototypical system that is able to work through a given plan (e.g. human provided), there is a plan executioner, so the robot drives through the field and records scans.\newline

Potentially integrate watchdog module that observers the battery state and acts as a fail-safe. In general, the charge stops should be part of the plan,
i.e. be considered at planning time. Thus, there has to be resource planning for the missions that includes to be back at the base station before the robot is out of battery.
However, if it fails, there is the watchdog module that is able to react to wrong plans, i.e. the battery is low before expected and the robot has to return to its base.
The module generally checks how far it is from the robot's current position to the base station, how much battery that would cost and how battery it still has.
In summary, the module is running at execution time, it is not planning the charge stops beforehand, it just reacts to failure cases, in which the robot has to preempt
the plan execution, drive back to its base and recharge. Therefore, in general it is planned to have both. The charge stops have to be considered at planning time,
so charging stops are part of the plan. Moreover, there is monitoring at execution time that looks for potential problems in this regard.\newline

Potentially integrate the docking solution for autonomous energy supply - could be really good and interesting if it works robustly.
It's not a hard requirement, just a nice-to-have.\newline

\section{Scientific and/or technological background}

\textbf{Challenges}\newline

Based on the growth state of the plants, the planning has to be adapted, which has to be evaluated in the simulation, because a long-term test that reflects
seasonal changes would clearly be beyond the scope of this work. So, besides the need for a simulation in terms of potential hardware-related or other hurdles
that prevent practical testing, we have another motivation for the simulation, which are seasonal changes that are needed in order to evaluate the different
planning strategies. From a certain date, the plants are too high to drive above them and the scans have to be taken from a different spot, the whole strategy changes.
When the plants are small enough, the scans are taken from above, when they become too big, that's no longer possible.
That is a typical constraint in agricultural projects - the vegetation periods.
In March, when this work is expected to end, the plants are going to be relatively small such that the robot can drive above them when taking
scans, in the end of srping and summer that would no longer be possible and will be reflected in the simuation.

\section{Approach}

The plan is to start from the goal backwards with the question of what is required in order to end up with a long-term autonomous system that is
able to perform those scans with changing environment conditions etc. in the simulation and ideally in practice on the real hardware.
A physica simulation in Gazebo is created as part of the research project PORTAL and might be exteneded as part of this work, e.g. with weather conditions.

\section{Expected scientific and/or technological contribution}

The idea of the long-term test is that the robot has to drive back to its charging station at least two times, otherwise it would be vacuous.
If possible, it would be good to include real weather data form the region of the test field.
